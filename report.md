In lab in week 2 I learned how to clone and push repositories from different servers. I thought it was very helpful to be able to have access to files and folders that are not actually on my local computer and modify them and then be able to push those changes back to the origin. In week 3, I learned about identifying bugs and symptoms from code and using testers and how to use them alongside programs. It allowed me to figure out what was wrong with the code such as logic errors, and change them so te output would be correct.
